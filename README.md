# About:
Kuku Kube is a simple vision test game where the player must find and click as many differently
colored tiles as quickly as possible. This is a bot to automatically play the game by capturing
the screen, detecting the different color, and pressing it. It can reach a score of above 500,
which is over 6x the human record of 87.

# How to Run:
- Download kuku.py
- Open the [game](https://kuku-kube.com/) in a browser window, and set it to fullscreen
